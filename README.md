# Timestamp-Microservice
The Timestamp Microservice project is a web API that processes timestamp-related requests. It is built using Node.js and Express.js. The API can handle various scenarios, such as returning the current Unix timestamp and UTC time if no date is provided, converting a valid date string to both Unix timestamp and UTC format, and handling error cases when an invalid date is provided. The project demonstrates the use of middleware functions in Express for tasks such as adding the current time to requests and validating date inputs. It is designed to meet specific test cases and requirements set by the FreeCodeCamp platform.
